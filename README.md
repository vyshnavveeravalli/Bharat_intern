Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Overview
The "Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine" project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on various health metrics. The project leverages the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful supervised learning method known for its effectiveness in classification tasks. This project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Objectives
Develop a predictive model using SVM to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
Preprocess and clean the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.
Select relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction of diabetes.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deploy the model in a user-friendly interface for real-time diabetes risk assessment.
Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available dataset containing medical and demographic data. The dataset includes features such as:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age (years)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize the data to ensure consistent feature scales.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Feature Selection:

Analyze the importance of features using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance scores.
Select the most relevant features for model training.
Model Training:

Train the SVM model on the training dataset.
Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using the test set and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analyze the model's confusion matrix to understand performance on different classes.
Model Deployment:

Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input their health metrics and receive a diabetes risk prediction.
Expected Outcomes
The final deliverable is a well-validated and reliable SVM model capable of predicting diabetes with high accuracy. Additionally, the project includes a user interface that allows easy access to the prediction model for healthcare professionals and individuals alike.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
